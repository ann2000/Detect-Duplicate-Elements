# Detect-Duplicate-Elements
Function that detects all duplicate elements in a list and prints it.

Given a list of objects, it returns a list that contains only those that are duplicated, in the order that they appeared for the first time in the original list. For example, for the input ["b", "a", "c", "c", "e", "a", "c", "d", "c", "d"], the answer should be ["a", "c", "d"].
